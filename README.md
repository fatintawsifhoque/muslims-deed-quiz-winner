# 🎉 Muslims Deed & Proyas Quiz Winner Selector

> **A dynamic, fair, and joyful tool to select quiz winners — built for community events with ❤️.**  
> Sponsored by **Proyas Prokashon**, organized by **Muslims Deed**.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

During community quizzes, selecting winners manually can feel biased or stressful.  
So I built a tool that’s:

- ✅ **100% fair** — pure randomness, no human error  
- ✅ **Fully dynamic** — add/edit/delete participants on the fly  
- ✅ **Celebratory** — winners announced with golden confetti!  
- ✅ **Community-first** — made for Muslims Deed events  

> *"The best among you are those who bring the most benefit to others."*  
> — Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)
